        I'm a multi-talented, hard working human. Currently I'm a student at Denver University studying coding for web development. I am studying multiple languages to become more useful as a well-rounded developer and also challenge myself with knowledge to use in the work field.

        I define myself by the work I want to do and not by the work I have already done. I like to use my high energy level with my boundless enthusiasm to learn new skills that both challenge and further improve my knowledge. I'm a passionate, expressive, and multi-talented individual who enjoys working on front-end developement. I like to create interfaces that many people enjoy using and at the same time being able to share what I've created proudly.

        I was born in Fayetville NC, but only lived there for a year. I spent most of my child hood in Anchorake AK and loved every second of it. Growing up I did a bunch of out door activites since Alaska was so Nature abundant. I remember most days fishing for salmon by the loading docks to playing outside in the culdesac with my group of friends. I was also a big enthusiast with video games, where I believe my love of technology started. Growing up I remember always getting the latest gadget in technology from game consoles to building computers with the latest part to buying the latest product in the Apple Generation. I moved to Denver CO at the start of highschool and been living here ever since. Lately I have been falling a little behind on the technology movement but now I am very motivated to get back into it and start developing ways to either contribute the growth of technology and help others to easily interface with the technology.

        On my free time I am a father of a beatiful daught that I enjoy spending every second I can with. My other hobbies that I enjoy include hiking, snowboarding, some minor gardening, and riding my motorcycle when the weather is permitting. I also volunteer and help out with The Blue Bench Organization when needed by attending events hosted by them.
